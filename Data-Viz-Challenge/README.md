# Data Visualization Challenge


You will be working with RNAseq data from the Immunological Genome Project (ImmGen) - a large research collaboration being build to characterise the gene expression of every immune cell in mice. Your task is to implement data visualization to look for interesting patterns in this data, and think about strategies to visualize RNAseq data.

You don't have to look at all the data, rather, you can focus on cell subsets that are interesting to you.

Normalized gene frequencies are found in `GSE109125_Gene_count_table.csv`. If you are interested in more details about the markers used for sorting, refer to `GSE109125_series_matrix.txt`.
